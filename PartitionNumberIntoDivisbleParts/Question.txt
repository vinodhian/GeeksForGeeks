Partition a number into two divisble parts
Given a number (as string) and two integers a and b, divide the string in two non-empty parts such that the first part is divisible by a and second part is divisible by b. If string can not be divided into two non-empty parts, output “NO”, else print “YES” with the two parts.

Examples:

Input  : str = "123", a = 12, b = 3
Output : YES
         12, 3
"12" is divisible by a and "3" is 
divisible by b. 

Input  : str = "1200", a = 4, b = 3
Output : YES
         12, 00

Input  : str = "125", a = 12, b = 3
Output : NO
